The website I made for Z3NITH'22.
So, this was the Z3NITH'22 website I had made in 2022 for my school's annual tech event, Z3NITH. It revoles around the theme of "Dawn: Age of Existence" thus symbolising hope and a new beginning. The website was inspired by various sources like Dune Movie and Eternals.

The extensions of files are kept in .php so as to keep any options open, if any portal or the live-server were to be really utilised for any event. The files were made in 2022, and there's a less chance, but still a chance that it may have a few broken hyperlinks, so I hope that's not gonna be the case.

This is one of my favourite works to this day. Hope you enjoy reliving the experience of 2022.
